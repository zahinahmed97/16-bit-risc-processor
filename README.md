This project contains:

1. project_modify.cpp= converts the assembly instructions stored in input.txt into binary language (stored in output.txt)
2. hexa.cpp= converts the binary instructions of output.txt into hexa code which can be used in logisim simulation
3. project.circ= the processor design.

to use:
store your desired input commands in input.txt (by seeing the instructions list)
run the project_modify.cpp code
run the hexa.cpp code
load the hexa.txt into logisim program counter
